*QUESTION1*
arr[i] means *(arr+i); where arr points to the first element of array.
similarly, i[arr] means *(i+arr).. since, *(arr+i) and *(i+arr) are same so there will be no error and all the elemnts of the array will be printed.

*QUESTION2*
Because cout operator "<<" is overloaded for char* and void*.
So for int array it is converted to void* and passed for the output which only gives the address of the first element.
While for character array it is converted to char* (dominates void* unless explicitly casted) and the operator treats it as string and prints whole character array.
If you want the address, try casting the character array as a void pointer.
